# 📁 Java File Manipulation & I/O Exercises
This repository contains a collection of exercises developed for the Systems Development course at FIAP. The main goal is to practice and demonstrate fundamental concepts of file manipulation (I/O) in Java.

## 📚 What's Inside?
This project includes practical examples covering various aspects of Java's file handling capabilities. Each class in the src directory focuses on a specific operation.

## Key Concepts Covered:
✍️ Writing to Files: Creating new files and writing data to them (WriteFileExample).

📖 Reading Files: Opening and reading content from existing files (ReadFileExample).

📋 Copying Files: Duplicating file content to a new location (CopyFileExample).

🗑️ Removing Files: Deleting files from the system (RemoveFileExample).

ℹ️ Getting File Metadata: Retrieving information about files, such as size and modification date (GetFileDataExample).

📂 Listing Directory Contents: Traversing directories and listing the files within them (ListFiles).

## 📸 Mini-Project: Photo Manager App
As a practical application of the concepts learned, this repository includes a basic Photo Manager App. This simple console application demonstrates how to combine different file operations to manage a collection of photos.
